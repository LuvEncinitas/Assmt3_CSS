  <p>As an active person, I plan to eagerly get involved in but not limited to local Business associations, Chamber of Commerce, and Rotary of America. These have proved excellent networking opportunities for me before. I enjoy Art, History and Music going to church and reading everyday, and some outdoor sports. 
 
    As a professional, I genuinely enjoy the facets of working with a team and being a team player. In College I was President of the inter-club Council, for 5 years now I have worked in all facets of Business and Sales except finance which I have a strong desire to learn and expand my knowledge. I also have experience-managing employees. My goals are to obtain my work for a progressive company.  I will dedicate my time and effort to constantly seeking council and executing new sales techniques. 
     
    I am poised to becoming the best customer service oriented employee as I can be and rising in the company as a top-producer. I am very driven, ambitious, dedicated and honest.  My references would say that I am a quick learner, self-motivated and an overall pleasant spirit to have around the office. 
      
    I would consider myself an avid computer user with excellent communications skills. Iâ€™m extremely goal-oriented and I have always enjoyed a challenge. I have worked well with a mentor in the past. I look forward to meeting and talking with you sometime very soon. </p>
